                   Hi there! I'm Kaeden Wile, and this is my personal website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before graduating from the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu">University of Washington
                    Paul G. Allen School</a> with a degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics, I spent 2
                    years working at <a href="https://www.onetrust.com/blog/onetrust-acquires-integris/">Integris
                    Software</a>, a privacy and regulation automation startup, which has since been bought by
                    OneTrust Software. I spent this past year as a Software Development Engineer at
                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/storagegateway">AWS Storage Gateway</a> on the
                    infrastructure team. Since my first Python programming book back in junior high, I've tried my
                    hand at everything from apps and games to websites and APIs and even some machine learning.
                    I'm an Apple fanboy, a software polyglot, and an aspiring entrepreneur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently a member of the <a href="https://ihopu.org/internships/one-thing/">One Thing
                    Internship at the Internation House of Prayer</a> in Kansas City. My passions include faith,
                    family, and music. My faith is central to how I live life and see the world around me. As a
                    Christian, I believe that Jesus is Lord, that the Bible is the Word of God, and that I am
                    called to love those around me. I'm extremely close with my family and enjoy spending time
                    with them. I love singing, playing guitar, and writing music.
                </p>
