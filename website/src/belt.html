                BELT is a space adventure game for iOS. Pilot your ship through a dangerous
                asteroid field, expertly weave your way between precarious openings, and
                collect extra fuel, valuable Helium-3, or experimental power-ups to
                increase your high-score!
            </p>

                BELT features custom music and sound effects created by Kaeden Wile.

                BELT started out as a college project for Kaeden Wile and Matt Vredevoogd,
                and was previously released under the name LANDR. Matt has become
                a real rocket scientist and Kaeden went to work for Amazon Web Services. The
                game has undergone many changes including being completely rewritten.
